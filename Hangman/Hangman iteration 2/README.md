#   Hangman 2
The scope expanded to allow a user to specify a .txt file for words as well as 
add a wy for the user to know if their guess was right or wrong.

To change .txt files i prompt the user to enter a ptaht to a specific one and if
one isn't I default to the one i used in hangman 1.

As for the information on a right or wrong guess I made use of if logic to 
compare the guessed letter to the letter at the replace letters index.
