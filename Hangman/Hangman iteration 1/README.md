#   Hangman 1
This projects goal where to access a text file of words and choose a random one 
from it then replace a random letter in the word with an _ and let the user 
guess the letter. The user only got one chance to guess.

I opened the file and converted into a list of words and then closed. I used 
random to select a random integer between 0 and the lenght of the list to use as 
an index int the list to choose a random word. I used a similar process for the 
letter.
