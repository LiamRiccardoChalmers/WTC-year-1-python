#   Mastermind 3

The task of this project was to remove global variables and use retunr values as
well as implement unit testing. 

THe return values and removal of globals was easy as I had 2 prior version that
used retunrs instead of globals.

Learning and tdd was tough but once i got the hang of it i found it was easy to 
implement it in myprojects going forward.
